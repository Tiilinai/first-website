                    <i>  ”What am I supposed to do, oh God help me… He's after me.”</i>
                    I pushed myself closer to the wall and held my breath. At the very same time, the first heavy footsteps broke the silence in the corridor. I whimpered with fear.
                    The panic had filled me to the brim, I was paralysed, couldn't move.
                    All of a sudden he stopped. Instead I could hear the sound of trembling hands against the wall. Fumbling, searching for something, or someone - and that someone was me. I didn't want to… I wanted to shut everything out and run away, away from it all but I couldn't! 
                    Suddenly all the noises had gone away - it became quiet, so quiet. I gave a start. It felt like someone had laid a hand, as cold as ice, on my shoulder. I quickly turned around, but no one was there.
                    The situation was so bizarre, but I didn't notice that, the only thing I could think of was the silence… this horrible silence. Oh God, it terrified me. I was more frightened than I'd ever been before.
                    No, I couldn't take this anymore. I had to see what was wrong.
                      I opened the door cautiously, but he was too fast! He snatched open the door with a furious roar. Never had I heard a sound like that - like a beast from the underground. From the mighty inferno of Hell he roared out all his hatred towards me.
                    I screamed and ran past him before he managed to react. His deathly pale, ice-cold hand grazed my shoulder and never before had I felt such cold spread in my body.
                    It paralyzed me. Made my steps become slower and slower… Soon enough he would catch me, but I didn't want to die.
                    <em>I didn't want to die.</em>
